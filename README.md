# Hello $World, apply{ Bedoy?.run{ codeWith(&travel) } }

As a highly skilled mobile developer with a focus on Android and iOS platforms, I possess a strong passion for both programming and music. My dedication to self-improvement is evidenced by my constant reading and learning of new technologies, as well as my eagerness to share knowledge with others.

In addition to my expertise in design patterns, code decoupling, flat design, and UX, I am also a self-producing musician with extensive experience playing guitar, ukulele, drums, bass, and keyboard, as well as composing original music.
